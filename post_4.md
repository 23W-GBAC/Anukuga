## Quinoa and Vegetable Stir-Fry:
Explore the versatility of quinoa with a vibrant and nutrient-rich vegetable stir-fry. Imagine colorful bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, and snap peas tossed together with pre-cooked quinoa. For a protein boost, consider adding tofu cubes or lean chicken strips. Drizzle a soy-ginger sauce for that perfect umami kick. Pro tip: Pre-cook a batch of quinoa during your weekly meal prep for quick and easy stir-fry assembly.

## Herb-Infused Grilled Salmon:
Indulge your palate with a succulent herb-infused grilled salmon. Marinate the salmon in a delightful blend of fresh herbs, lemon juice, and garlic before grilling to perfection. This dish not only offers a burst of flavor but also provides essential omega-3 fatty acids for heart health. Consider using a cedar plank during grilling for an added smoky aroma and depth of flavor.

## Spaghetti Squash Primavera:
Revamp your pasta routine with a nutritious twist – spaghetti squash primavera. Roast the spaghetti squash for a caramelized flavor and toss it with a homemade tomato sauce, an array of colorful vegetables, and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. This light and satisfying dish is a low-carb alternative to traditional pasta, ensuring a guilt-free indulgence.

# Cooking Tips:

## Seasoning without Sodium:
Enhance your dishes with depth and flavor without relying on excessive salt. Experiment with a blend of cumin, paprika, and garlic powder for a savory twist. These spices not only add richness but also bring out the natural flavors of your ingredients.

## Smart Substitutions for Healthier Meals:
Make healthier choices by substituting refined grains with whole grains. Opt for lean proteins such as chicken or fish and replace saturated fats with heart-healthy alternatives like olive oil or avocado. For example, use cauliflower rice instead of traditional rice for a low-carb and nutritious option.

## Batch Cooking for Convenience:
Simplify your meal prep routine by batch-cooking staples like quinoa, brown rice, and roasted vegetables. This time-saving technique ensures you have healthy components ready to assemble into quick and delicious meals throughout the week. Imagine effortlessly creating a nutritious stir-fry with pre-cooked quinoa after a busy day.

## Balanced Plate Philosophy:
Adopt the balanced plate approach for a well-rounded and nutritious meal. Combine a lean protein source like grilled chicken breast with whole grains such as quinoa. Pair it with a vibrant salad featuring a mix of colorful vegetables. This philosophy ensures you enjoy a nutritionally balanced dinner that satisfies both your palate and your body's needs.
