# Problem and Context of the Automation

In the era of information overload, keeping track of the latest health news tailored to one's locality can be challenging. Traditional news platforms may not always prioritize local health concerns, leading to a gap in accessible and relevant information. Additionally, manually browsing through various sources to gather such data can be time-consuming and inefficient.

# Possible Solutions and Errand Attempts to Develop a Solution
Several approaches could address the problem outlined above:

## Manual Aggregation: Initially, manually curating health news relevant to different regions might seem feasible. However, this approach is labor-intensive and prone to inconsistencies. It also lacks scalability as it cannot accommodate a growing user base.

## Automated Data Retrieval: Utilizing APIs like News API and IPinfo API, we can automate the process of fetching health news based on the user's location. This approach significantly reduces manual effort and ensures real-time access to relevant information.

## Web Application Development: Building a user-friendly web application using frameworks like Flask allows for seamless interaction with the automated data retrieval system. Incorporating responsive design ensures accessibility across various devices.

## Final Solution
The Local Health News app combines automated data retrieval with a user-friendly interface to deliver personalized health news based on the user's geographical location. By leveraging the News API and IPinfo API, the app dynamically fetches and displays the latest health headlines specific to the user's country. The Flask web application ensures smooth functionality, while responsive design enhances usability.

# Advantages:
## Personalization: Users receive health news tailored to their locality, enhancing relevance and engagement.
## Efficiency: Automation reduces manual effort in sourcing and curating news content, saving time and resources.
## Accessibility: The web application's responsive design ensures accessibility across different devices, maximizing reach.
# Disadvantages:
## Dependence on External APIs: Reliability of the app relies on the uptime and performance of external APIs like News API and IPinfo API.
## Limited Scope: The app currently focuses on health news; expanding to cover other domains might require additional development effort and resources.
Cost-Benefit-Analysis
# Time and Resources Invested:
## Development Time: Approximately 4 weeks for initial development and testing.
## Resources: Minimal cost for hosting the web application and accessing external APIs.
# Time and Resources Saved:
## Manual Effort: Estimated to save 1 hour daily for each user in searching for relevant health news.
## Scalability: As the user base grows, the time and resources saved scale accordingly.
# Economic Benefits:
Considering the time and resources saved over the next 5 years, the automation proves economically beneficial:
The app also saves the data one would hane used on the internet surfing for information.

## Estimated time saved per user over 5 years: 1825 hours.
Corresponding labor cost savings based on average hourly wage.
Overall, the Local Health News app offers substantial time savings and enhanced accessibility, making it economically viable in the long run.
